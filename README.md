# Olympics-in-tokyo-2021-Database
Games are always interesting to me. This data source matches with my interest and it gives a good scope to understand different perspectives of data like, games, athletes, coaches and achievements etc. This is a good source for the scope of database understanding. The datasets taken for this project are Athletes, Coaches, Teams participating , Medals as well as the Entries by gender. These datasets contains the details of over 11,000 athletes, with 47 disciplines, along with 743 teams taking part in the 2021(2020) Tokyo Olympics. It contains their names, countries represented, discipline, gender of competitors, name of the coaches. This dataset link contains xlsx files. I will try to import these datasets into the POSTGRESQL using the import option available. I will create same datatypes as  of xlsx data as it is necessary for same datatypes when importing.  We will be using many datatypes like text integers enums to acquire hands on knowledge and to give preciseness of data storage.
